# GBDX-tutorial-notebooks

This set of tutorial notebooks is focused on getting new users introduced to working with and analyzing DigitalGlobe satellite imagery using [GBDXtools](https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/gbdxtools).  The curriculum is focused on DigitalGlobe's data access patterns for imagery, and the analysis piece covers image sciecne concepts like band math, spectral indices and base layer matching.  The notebooks were written to work within the hosted GBDX Notebook environment, so some of the instructions on using the interactive image discovery interface won't apply to using the notebooks outside of the environment.  There are notebooks on using GBDXtools to disover imagery, and you can always use the [catalog search docs](https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/gbdxtools/blob/master/docs/catalog_search.rst) as a fall back.  If you need help defining a bounding box for your searches outside of the GBDX Notebooks app I like the [Klokantech app](http://boundingbox.klokantech.com/).
